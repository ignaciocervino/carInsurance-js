# Car Insurance calculation
Here is a small projects using prototypes in JavaScript.
First I create a Insurance object constructor with 3 variables and adding some prototypes like 'cotizarSeguro'
to get the total amount to pay that depends on the year, brand and type of insurance.
I create a empty object constructor for the User Interface UI and add some prototypes such as filling the options and
display the results.

Once the user select the brand, year, type of insurance the app will display the details and total amount to pay. In case
he dosnt enter one of the inputs shows a error message.
